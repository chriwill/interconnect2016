# Welcome to IBM InterConnect 2016

In this interactive lab session, we will build a cloud application using IBM Bluemix in fifteen minutes. The tutorial/demo will showcase the advantage of combining and using multiple services like Cloudant as storage, Watson as an analytics engine and Node-RED to build/design the application. During this session, you will have a choice to build an application either using (a) Watson Visual Recognition service or (b) Watson Tradeoff Analytics service in Bluemix. -

Watson Tradeoff Analytics - Build a travel advisor application that helps to analyze flight data and pick the best flight option based on individual preferences.
