[Sample Flight Data](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/chriwill/interconnect2016/master/flightstradeoffanalytics/data/flightdata.json)

1.) Create Node-RED Application on Bluemix

Once you're logged in to your Bluemix account go to 'Catalog' and click on the 'Node-RED starter' application. On the right side of the screen you must give it a name, which must be unique. Then click 'Create'. Right now the Node-RED application is being created and deployed. This will take a few minutes.
